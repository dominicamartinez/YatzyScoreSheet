# YatzyScoreSheet
Yahtzy Score Sheet

I just wanted a score sheet for triple yahtzy, triple yahtzee, and any other variation of the game on my phone.
Similar apps exist in the playstore but they contain ads and are seemingly less lightweight.

There are a few things to note about this program that is done for my purposes and how I use it:
1. There is no error checking on the values entered on a score line. 
For example, the possible values for 1's is 0 through 5 but you can put 47 if you wanted, which is impossible in the game but the app don't care.
2. You'll get warnings from Android studio complaining about using string resources.
I doubt this is ever going to get a translation or anything like that, so hard-coded values is fine.
